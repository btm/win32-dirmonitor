== Description
  A class for monitoring directories on MS Windows.

== Installation
  gem install win32-dirmonitor

== Synopsis
  require 'win32/dirmonitor'
  include Win32

  # Wait for a change in your home directory and report any changes.

  monitor = Win32::DirMonitor.new(ENV['HOME'])

  # Wait up to 5 minutes for a change journals
  monitor.wait(300){ |struct|
    puts 'Something changed'
    puts 'File: ' + struct.file
    puts 'Action: ' + struct.action
    struct.changes.each do |change|
      puts "Change: " + change[0].to_s
      puts "Old: " + change[1].to_s
      puts "New: " + change[2].to_s

== Notes
  This supplants the win32-changenotify library.

== Future Plans
  Allow files in subdirectories to be monitored as well.

== Known Bugs  
  None that I know of. Please log any bug reports on the RubyForge
  project page at https://github.com/djberg96/win32-dirmonitor.
