== Description
  A class for monitoring directories on MS Windows.

== Installation
  gem install win32-dirmonitor

== Synopsis
   require 'win32/dirmonitor'
   include Win32

   # Indefinitely wait for a change in 'C:\Users' and report any changes.
   monitor = DirMonitor.new('C:/Users')

   monitor.wait{ |struct|
      array.each{ |info|
         p info.file_name
         p info.action
         p info.path
      }
   }

   c.delete
	
== Notes
   Based on what the MSDN documentation says, this library requires NTFS, and
   should be preferred on that filesystem. On FAT filesystems, you should
   use the win32-changenotify library instead.

== Acknowledgements
   This library was originally based on the CJTest module by Jeffrey
   Cooperstein & Jeffrey Richter.
	
== Future Plans
   Add a method for iterating over all change records.

== Known Bugs  
   None that I know of. Please log any bug reports on the RubyForge
   project page at http://www.rubyforge.net/projects/win32utils
